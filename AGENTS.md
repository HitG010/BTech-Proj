# Repository orientation

Snapshot checked 2026-09-23. Verify `git status --short --branch` and
`git worktree list` before relying on branch names or this snapshot.

- This worktree, `/Users/hiteshgupta/Documents/BTechProj`, is on
  `research/router-studies` at `15a4d2d` when this note was written. It was
  clean before this documentation update. Router studies 2–8 are committed on
  this branch; `master` remains at `0087b92` and is not the current checkout.
- The sibling worktree `/Users/hiteshgupta/Documents/BTechProj-pilot-v2` is on
  `research/pilot-v2` at `6c7903c`. It was also clean. Its prompt, token caps,
  backend and scorer differ from the router-studies branch. `numeric-v3` and
  `numeric-v4` have different meanings on the two branches; reconcile protocols
  and give parser versions unique identities before combining their results.
- Start with [the research map](docs/README.md) for study results, code layout,
  artifact paths and reading order. [The root README](README.md) covers setup and
  commands; [the plan](plan.md) is the milestone and execution log. Source is in
  `src/reasoning_budget/`, offline tests in `tests/`, configurations in
  `configs/`, and research notes in `docs/`.
- `artifacts/`, `.cache/`, `.python/` and `.venv/` are local and ignored by Git.
  The pilot-v2 worktree shares `.cache/`, `.python/` and `artifacts/runs/` with
  this worktree through symlinks. Preserve existing run records and frozen study
  identities. Its `artifacts/data/` is a separate directory.
- The 3,100-question confirmation in
  `artifacts/confirmation/frozen-router-v1/` is prepared for the **unchanged**
  joint router; `status.json` says generation has not started. The user deferred
  its 125–142-hour local run to improve the router first. The official 500-test
  split is sealed. The human scoring audit was explicitly waived.
- The cached-trace CPU test is complete; see
  [router development results](docs/router-dev-results.md) and
  `artifacts/router-dev/shared-base-v1/report.md`. On 200 reused development
  questions, the shared-correctness router improved over refitted joint and
  gain-ridge models, but at the preselected `λ=.05` tuned confidence matched its
  90.25% accuracy with fewer generated tokens (589.4 versus 622.0 per question).
  A higher-accuracy, low-penalty part of the curve is exploratory. This is not
  independent confirmation. Do not treat the prepared 3,100-question protocol
  as a test of the new router. The next candidate is selective verification of
  wrong direct-draft agreements, though only 11 such cases exist in development.
