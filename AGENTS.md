# Repository orientation

Snapshot checked 2026-10-01. Verify `git status --short --branch` and
`git worktree list` before relying on branch names or this snapshot.

- This worktree, `/Users/hiteshgupta/Documents/BTechProj`, is on
  `codex/research-data-efficiency`, created from `research/router-studies` at
  `15a4d2d`. The pre-existing documentation and shared-router work were
  checkpointed at `1b67fbc` before Phase 1 changes. Router studies 2–8 remain in
  its history; `master` at `0087b92` is not the current checkout.
- The sibling worktree `/Users/hiteshgupta/Documents/BTechProj-pilot-v2` is on
  `research/pilot-v2` at `6c7903c`. It was also clean. Its prompt, token caps,
  backend and scorer differ from the historical router-studies branch.
  `numeric-v3` and `numeric-v4` have different historical meanings. The active
  branch now uses `numeric-v5` and `qwen3-boxed-budget-v3`; the
  [protocol record](docs/phase-1-protocol-reconciliation.md) explains the merge.
  A real 25-question generation bridge is next; historical generation
  protocols are still not interchangeable.
- Start with [the research map](docs/README.md) for study results, code layout,
  artifact paths and reading order. [The root README](README.md) covers setup and
  commands; [the plan](plan.md) is the milestone and execution log. Source is in
  `src/reasoning_budget/`, offline tests in `tests/`, configurations in
  `configs/`, and research notes in `docs/`.
- `artifacts/`, `.cache/`, `.python/` and `.venv/` are local and ignored by Git.
  The pilot-v2 worktree shares `.cache/`, `.python/` and `artifacts/runs/` with
  this worktree through symlinks. Preserve existing run records and frozen study
  identities. Its `artifacts/data/` is a separate directory.
- `artifacts/legacy/router-studies-6999eb5/` is a detached legacy checkout for
  frozen-study commands. Use its `src/` through `PYTHONPATH` from this root; the
  shared editable environment alone imports the current source. The new code
  correctly rejects legacy frozen studies. Current offline verification is
  195 tests; no new generation, gold/test access, or cloud spend in checkpoint 2.
- The 3,100-question confirmation in
  `artifacts/confirmation/frozen-router-v1/` is prepared for the **unchanged**
  joint router; `status.json` says generation has not started. The user deferred
  its 125–142-hour local run to improve the router first. The official 500-test
  split is sealed. The human scoring audit was explicitly waived.
- The active [research roadmap](docs/research-roadmap.md) targets data-efficient
  acquisition, with protocol repair and supervision diagnosis before scaling.
  Jev/RL are conditional extensions. Do not treat generic RL, agreement, or
  cost-aware acquisition as an established novel contribution.
- The cached-trace CPU test is complete; see
  [router development results](docs/router-dev-results.md) and
  the corrected `artifacts/router-dev/shared-base-v2/report.md` (v1 preserved).
  The standalone-thinking cost was corrected from 1,654.47 to 1,430.69 tokens;
  all six other policies and the legacy generator are unchanged. On 200 reused development
  questions, the shared-correctness router improved over refitted joint and
  gain-ridge models, but at the preselected `λ=.05` tuned confidence matched its
  90.25% accuracy with fewer generated tokens (589.4 versus 622.0 per question).
  A higher-accuracy, low-penalty part of the curve is exploratory. This is not
  independent confirmation. Do not treat the prepared 3,100-question protocol
  as a test of the new router. Only 11 wrong direct-draft agreements exist in
  development, so selective verification remains a limited optional direction.
- Phase 1 checkpoint 3 freezes all new GSM8K roles in
  `artifacts/research/data-efficiency-v1/allocations/manifest.json`: 25 bridge,
  50 repeat, one 1,200-question acquisition pool, 200 validation, 2,000 new sealed
  confirmation, 548 reserve. Preparation reads question-only source rows; loading
  validates live inventory/source hashes, source index, exclusions and pool roles.
  The [paired bridge](docs/phase-1-bridge.md) is implemented with 100 responses per
  arm, common v5 scoring only after all 200 complete, and unchanged old code at
  `6999eb5`. All 212 offline tests pass; real local collection is next.
